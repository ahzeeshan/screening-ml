Scheme for Linear Regression

- Make datasets for different symmetries - matlab arrays with Cij
- Make feature datasets for different symmetries - matlab arrays with feature data - normalized

- Perform linear regression for each symmetry type
- Perform regularization, feature reduction 
- Predict elastic tensor for each symmetry

Notes:

IEEE standards of crystal orientation for the elastic tensor of different materials
Problem of point groups:

Systems with 

1 type of elastic tensor: triclinic, monoclinic, orthorhombic, cubic, hexagonal
2 - Tetragonal 6 and 7 constants; trigonal 6 and 7

Hexagonal crystal system has an incorrect asymmetric entry for the elastic tensor
